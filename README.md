# UCSF-UIMAnalysis
---

Please find the Jupyter notebook titled "Analysis(TopicModeling+SentimentAnalysis).ipynb" which contains the finalized models used in our analysis project. This notebook is organized into clearly marked sections for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, as well as data cleaning, embedding, and modeling. These sections are easily identifiable through markdown blocks within the notebook.

Additionally, early versions of the topic modeling and sentiment analysis models, which were explored during the initial phase of the project, are included for reference. You'll find these in the notebooks named "sentimentAna(with-fine-tuning-code-for-reference).ipynb" and "TopicModeling(BERT-with-HBSCAN).ipynb."

For visualizations, we utilized the matplotlib.pyplot package, and the relevant code can be found in the "visualization.ipynb" notebook.

A requirements.txt file is included to list all packages I installed in my python-3.9.16 environment.

Should you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out to me.
